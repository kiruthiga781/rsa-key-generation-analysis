# 🔐 RSA Key Generation Time Analyzer

This mini project analyzes how long it takes to generate RSA keys of different sizes using Python’s `pycryptodome` library.  
It helps understand how the RSA key size affects the time taken for key generation.

## 📘 Project Overview
RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) is a public-key cryptographic algorithm widely used for secure data transmission.  
Larger key sizes improve security but require more computation time.  
This program measures that time for different key lengths.
